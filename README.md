# SoilVantage

Soilvantage aims to empower farmers by providing insights into soil moisture levels using NASA’s volumetric soil moisture data. Our goal is to help farmers make informed decisions about irrigation, conserve water, and optimize their crop yields.

Our resources and tools are being designed to benefit not only farmers currently facing challenges with their yields but also those just starting out, and, ambitiously, even those managing large, well-established farms.

# Current Features

### Soil Moisture Predictions

We leverage a machine learning model to estimate soil moisture levels based on historical data from previous years. Once a user enters a location and select a month, they can get an estimate of the moisture levels in the area. This model provides accurate predictions when future conditions follow historical trends. However, we acknowledge that climate change introduces new variables that may impact our predictions. To improve the model's adaptability and accuracy, we plan to integrate near-real-time data, periodically retraining the model with NASA's latest volumetric moisture updates. This will allow us to keep up with rapidly changing conditions and provide farmers with the most current insights.

### Irrigation Tips

We provide tailored irrigation recommendations based on soil type, guiding farmers in selecting the most suitable irrigation methods for their unique circumstances.

# Future Vision

### One-Stop Resource

We aspire to become a one-stop resource for water-related farming education. We plan on expanding the platform to offer guides, tutorials, and interactive tools, allowing farmers to make informed decisions and confidently manage their water resources.


### Precise Water Measurements

While we currently offer irrigation tips when users select soil types, we aim to introduce precise water quantity recommendations tailored to specific soil types and crop needs. This will help farmers make more informed decisions and optimize water usage.


### Identifying Soil Types

Acknowledging that many farmers, especially those new to agriculture, may not be familiar with their soil type, we plan to provide accessible tools and resources to help them identify their soil characteristics. This will enable more accurate irrigation guidance and better water management.

### Near-Real-Time Data Integration

At present, our moisture level predictions rely on historical data from previous years. While this approach works well when future conditions mirror the past, climate change introduces significant variability. To enhance accuracy, we aim to integrate near-real-time data by periodically updating our model with NASA’s latest volumetric soil moisture information. This will allow us to adapt to evolving climate conditions and provide more reliable predictions for the months ahead.

# Our Journey and Next Steps

Looking back, The Crop Dusters is proud of how far we've come with the limited time we had. We had a blast at NASA's hackathon, pushing ourselves to make the most of every moment. But we know there's still a long way to go. Our goals and dreams for Soilvantage are much bigger than where we are right now, and this is just the start of what we hope to achieve.
